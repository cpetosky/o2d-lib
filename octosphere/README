Basic instructions:

 0) Verify if you actually need the sudo in the commands below -- depending
    on how your machine is set up, you may or may not need rights to bind to
    certain ports. Windows machines, for example, can generally bind on any
    port as non-admin, while most Linux machines require rights for port 80
    but not for the Minecraft ports.

 1) Get all the dependencies:
  * Python >= 2.7 (2.6 will probably work too, but haven't tested it)
  * CherryPy >= 3.1.2
  * cypy.minecraft >= 1.0 (included)
  * octosphere >= 1.0 (included)

 2) Spin up a minecraft server:
  * sudo python -m cypy.minecraft server <secret>

  Whatever secret you choose when you spin up the server is used for the
  following services.

 3) Spin up a console command client and feature extender:
  * sudo python -m octocraft.console <secret>

 4) Spin up the HTTP server:
  * sudo python -m octocraft.web <secret>

 5) Spin up the IRC bot:
  * sudo python -m octocraft.irc <secret>
